In an attempt to develop a highly user-cofigurable radar scenario generator with control over the waveform design, kinematics of the radar (tx, rx) bearing platforms, channel and propagation medium modelling and finally encapsulating this into a user-friendly GUI, a series of scripts were written to first independently test and validate the operation of the features before integrating them with the main script in the  form of functions.
These scripts range all the way from testing TCP/IP and UDP communication protocols, to coding an interactable free-hand drawing mechanism on the figure axis. Each code includes basic information on what is happening and the intention and goal of the script.
The file naming format is as follows: "test_'name of operation being tested'_yymmdd"
