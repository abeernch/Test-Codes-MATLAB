% The RCS equation used in the code is:

% RCS = (4 * pi * A^2 / lambda^2) * [(pi * width * zeta / lambda)^2] * [(2 * gamma / (k * width))^2]

% where:

% RCS is the radar cross-section of the flat plate in square meters
% A is the area of the flat plate in square meters
% lambda is the wavelength of the incident radiation in meters
% width is the width of the flat plate in meters
% zeta is the surface impedance of the flat plate in ohms
% gamma is the edge impedance of the flat plate in ohms
% k is the wave number of the incident radiation in meters^-1

% Constants
c = 299792458; % Speed of light in m/s
eps_0 = 8.854187817e-12; % Permittivity of free space in F/m
mu_0 = 4 * pi * 1e-7; % Permeability of free space in H/m
eta = sqrt(mu_0 / eps_0); % Impedance of free space in ohms

% Flat plate dimensions
len = 1; % Length of the plate in meters
width = 1; % Width of the plate in meters
area = len * width; % Area of the plate in square meters

% Transmit frequency range
freq_start = 3e9; % Starting frequency in Hz
freq_stop = 18e9; % Stopping frequency in Hz
num_freq_points = 1000; % Number of frequency points
freq = linspace(freq_start, freq_stop, num_freq_points); % Frequency range in Hz

% Calculate RCS for each frequency
rcs = zeros(size(freq));
for i = 1:length(freq)
    lambda = c / freq(i); % Wavelength in meters
    k = 2 * pi / lambda; % Wave number in m^-1
    alpha = k * width; % Width parameter
    beta = k * len; % Length parameter
    zeta = sqrt(eta^2 - (sin(alpha))^2); % Surface impedance
    gamma = sqrt(eta^2 - (sin(beta))^2); % Edge impedance
    term1 = ((pi * width * zeta) / lambda)^2; % First term in RCS equation
    term2 = ((2 * gamma) / (k * width))^2; % Second term in RCS equation
    rcs(i) = term1 * term2 * area; % RCS in square meters
